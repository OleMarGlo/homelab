Welcome to my homelab configs!
 Here i plan to upload my terraform an k3s configuration that i will use to host whatever i want
## How does my cluster work?
The plan is to use a proxmox cluster with (for now) three machines working in a cluster. The goal is to learn more about DevOps aswell as releasing my own code to the public. NixOS (again for now) is what i am planning to use, if not that good old ubuntu is always a choice.
